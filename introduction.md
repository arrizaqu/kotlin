## Why Kotlin
### Statically Types
Kotlin is a Statically typed programming language. This means that the type of every variable and expression is known at compile time.

The advantage with static typing is that the compiler can validate the methods calls and property access on the objects at compile time itself and prevent lots of trivial bugs that would otherwise crop up at runtime.

Although Kotlin is a statically typed language, it doesnâ€™t require you to explicitly specify the type of every variable you declare. Most of the time, Kotlin can infer the type of a variable from the initializer expression or the surrounding context. This is called Type Inference
